# BitwiseOperatorApp
This is a React JS Application that demonstrates visually bitwise operators available for one or two numbers (all interactive).

View (and test) the project here: https://aidennelsonsportfolio.github.io/BitwiseOperatorApp/

You will be asked to input 2 different numbers, with each one having the ability to have its bits shifted left or right interactively and live update its new value.

Then, at the bottom, you can select one of 3 different operations to perform on the 2 above input numbers, AND, OR, or XOR.

For bitwise operations, AND takes the two bits, and, if they are both 1's, the resulting number's bit is set to a 1 as well. Otherwise, the bit is set to a 0.

Alternatively, with the OR operator, if one of the two corresponding bits of a number are a 1, the resulting bit of the other number is a 1 also.

Lastly, the XOR operator compares each pair of bits, and if they are both the same, the resulting bit is a 0, 
but if they are different (1, 0, or 0, 1), the result's bit is set to 1.

Have fun, I hope this helps you to learn more about bitwise operators and their use!
